## Quick Start

### 1. Searching Text on Maps

In addition to a traditional search of Catalog Data (e.g. titles, authors, dates), the Luna Viewer now allows you to search the text content of many maps. We call this ‘Text on Maps”. 

Only maps that have been geo-referenced can be searched by the text they contain.

Using the Advanced Search, you can perform combined searches of Catalog Data and map text. 




### 2. Annotating Text on Maps

Not only can you view the text you searched for, you can also view all other text on this map and correct the underlying data!


 When you arrive from the search page, you will see only your search term highlighted. To see or hide all Text on Maps for this map, click on the icon you see below in the top left corner of the map image.

To edit a particular selection, click on the highlighted text. Now, you will see the annotation pop up. To learn more about how to annotate (correct, confirm, etc.) text on maps, read this guidance.


To edit an incorrect bounding polygon around text, click on the highlighted text. In the pop up, click ‘edit’. You will see the vertices of the polygon appear: you can move these to improve the way that the polygon surrounds the text, or you can delete a polygon that has been created in error. Read this guidance for more details.


***Please note, you must be logged in to edit the data.***
