# Guide to Searching and Annotating Text on Maps

- Learn about new and experimental features that have been introduced to a subset of maps in the David Rumsey Map Collection. 
- Discover what’s new, how to make the most of the new available tools, and how new computational methods enabled this new way search maps. 
- Find out how to get involved.


## Quick Start

### 1. Searching Text on Maps

In addition to a traditional search of Catalog Data (e.g. titles, authors, dates), the Luna Viewer now allows you to search the text content of many maps. We call this ‘Text on Maps”. 

Only maps that have been geo-referenced can be searched by the text they contain.

Using the Advanced Search, you can perform combined searches of Catalog Data and map text. 




### 2. Annotating Text on Maps

Not only can you view the text you searched for, you can also view all other text on this map and correct the underlying data!


 When you arrive from the search page, you will see only your search term highlighted. To see or hide all Text on Maps for this map, click on the icon you see below in the top left corner of the map image.

To edit a particular selection, click on the highlighted text. Now, you will see the annotation pop up. To learn more about how to annotate (correct, confirm, etc.) text on maps, read this guidance.


To edit an incorrect bounding polygon around text, click on the highlighted text. In the pop up, click ‘edit’. You will see the vertices of the polygon appear: you can move these to improve the way that the polygon surrounds the text, or you can delete a polygon that has been created in error. Read this guidance for more details.


***Please note, you must be logged in to edit the data.***


## What is Map Text?
About 60,000 of the georeferenced maps from the collection have been processed with a machine learning tool called mapKurator to collect all the map text, i.e. every piece of text (printed or handwritten) that appears on a map, including place names, but also information like a map’s title or its scale, or the names of the people involved in producing the map. Through this process of automatic annotation, this approach turns the map text into structured data (map text data): the enormous amount of map text data that has been collected from 60,000 maps is now searchable. 

*You can now search this part of the collection for any place, or other word, appearing anywhere on the maps, no matter how small or obscure.* 

### Why is this different?
Usually, when you browse a catalogue of digitised maps, the words that you type in your search are matched against metadata stored in a record about each document. This usually includes essential information documented by librarians or archivists such as a title, the creator’s name, the publication details, the size of the media, brief description, and other fields depending on the media, the history of the collection that the item belongs to, and the resources of the holding institution. 

Metadata are, in a way, the digital heirs of the content that was written on library cards or in collection inventories for centuries. They are therefore a vital component of any digital library or archive. It is thanks to metadata that we are able to find anything. However, given the history of using record metadata to capture information about an item rather than its content, it’s not logistically possible for metadata to store the information about every single place mentioned in each map. This is the reason why, if you look for a place in a map collection, you can only find maps that have that name appearing in their metadata.

Making it possible to search roughly 50% of the David Rumsey Map Collection based on the content of a map rather than only its metadata is a major shift in the history of searching cartographic collections. While we have been used for several years to searching books via their content as well as their titles and authors, such technology has not yet been applied to visual media like maps. Exposing text on maps alongside traditional catalog record metadata transforms how people search maps and why people might be interested in historical maps altogether: now the content of large sets of maps can be examined as data that tells us not only about the history or cultural context of specific places, or of specific mapping traditions, but also about broader social and cultural developments. 

If you are interested in working with this data using your own computational methods, you can access the full, open access dataset alongside its documentation. Please note that this machine-generated (inferred) data has not been evaluated, validated, or otherwise improved. It therefore contains many errors which will vary significantly depending on many factors. 

### How do you identify map text at scale?
The new features that you can now explore and use are the product of an exciting international and multidisciplinary collaboration supported by David Rumsey. 

This work builds on research previously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities in the US and the Arts and Humanities Research Council in the UK for the Machines Reading Maps project. In addition to David Rumsey, the team working on this new collaboration includes:

- Yao-Yi Chiang, a computer scientist at the University of Minnesota 
- [name PhD students] 
- Drake Zabriskie and David Wong at Luna Imaging 
- Rainer Simon, a developer specializing in data visualization and annotation 
- Katie McDonough and Valeria Vitale, two digital humanities researchers based at Lancaster University and Sheffield University, respectively. In the UK, the project has been based at The Alan Turing Institute.

To learn more about the methods used here, check out the dedicated Github repositories for 1) the mapKurator tool for generating map text data, and 2) the annotation interface embedded within the website.
