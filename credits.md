# Credits and Acknowledgements

The new features that you can now explore and use are the product of an exciting international and multidisciplinary collaboration supported by David Rumsey. 

Valeria Vitale and Katie McDonough prepared this Help Guide with input from the team.

This work builds on research previously funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) and the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) for the Machines Reading Maps project. 

In addition to David Rumsey, the team working on this collaboration includes (in alphabetical order):

- Yao-Yi Chiang, University of Minnesota
- Leeje Jang, University of Minnesota
- Jina Kim, University of Minnesota
- Zekun Li, University of Minnesota
- Yijun Lin, University of Minnesota
- Katie McDonough, The Alan Turing Institute
- Min Namgung, University of Minnesota
- Tanisha Shrotriya, University of Minnesota
- Rainer Simon, Independent Developer 
- Valeria Vitale, Sheffield University
- David Wong, Luna Imaging
- Drake Zabriskie, Luna Imaging 

We thank Deborah Holmes-Wong (University of Southern California, and US PI on the NEH side of the Machines Reading Maps project) for her expertise and continued engagement. Our Machines Reading Maps project partners at the National Library of Scotland, the British Library, and the Library of Congress have been key interlocutors on all things related to searching and finding text on maps. 

We especially extend our gratitude to Chris Fleet and the Maps team at the NLS for organizing an early experiment in crowdsourcing annotations of text on maps using software that inspired the Rumsey annotation interface and user experience.

We also wish to thank colleagues at the David Rumsey Map Center at Stanford Libraries, and in particular Salim Mohammed, Stace Maples, and Nicole Coleman for their support.
